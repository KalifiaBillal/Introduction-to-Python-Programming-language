## What is Python ?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 

## What is difference between Python 2 and Python 3?

| Basis of comparison	 | Python 3	          | Python 2      |
| :---:                |     :---:          |          :---: |
| Function print       | print ("hello")	  | print "hello" |
| Division of Integers     | Whenever two integers are divided, you get a float value	       | When two integers are divided, you always provide integer value.      |
| Unicode                |     In Python 3, default storing of strings is Unicode.          |          To store Unicode string value, you require to define them with "u". |
| Syntax            |     The syntax is simpler and easily understandable          |          The syntax of Python 2 was comparatively difficult to understand. |
| :---:                |     :---:          |          :---: |
| :---:                |     :---:          |          :---: |
