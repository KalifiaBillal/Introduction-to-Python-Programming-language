## What is Python ?

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. 

## What is difference between Python 2 and Python 3?

| Basis of comparison	 | Python 3	          | Python 2      |
| :---:                |     :---:          |          :---: |
| Function print       | print ("hello")	  | print "hello" |
| Division of Integers | Whenever two integers are divided, you get a float value	 | When two integers are divided, you always provide integer value |
| Unicode              |     In Python 3, default storing of strings is Unicode    | To store Unicode string value, you require to define them with "u"  |
| Syntax               |     The syntax is simpler and easily understandable       | The syntax of Python 2 was comparatively difficult to understand      |
| Rules of ordering Comparisons  |     In this version, Rules of ordering comparisons have been simplified  |  Rules of ordering comparison are very complex |
| Iteration            |  The new Range() function introduced to perform iterations |  In Python 2, the xrange() is used for iterations |
| Exceptions           |     It should be enclosed in parenthesis          |          It should be enclosed in notations |
| Leak of variables    |     The value of variables never changes          |          The value of the global variable will change while using it inside for-loop |
| Backward compatibility                |     Not difficult to port python 2 to python 3 but it is never reliable          |          Python version 3 is not backwardly compatible with Python 2 |
| Library                |     Many recent developers are creating libraries which you can only use with Python 3          |          Many recent developers are creating libraries which you can only use with Python 3.	Many older libraries created for Python 2 is not forward-compatible |
